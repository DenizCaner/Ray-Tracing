CMake Deprecation Warning at /Users/edacaner/Desktop/MasterStudies/VT19/ComputerGraphics/Assignments/assignment4_raytracer-master/external/glfw/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
